 * this interface.
 * <p>
 * A {@link MapClient} object activates its location provider using {@link
 * #activate(OnLocationChangedListener)}. While active (between {@link
 * #activate(OnLocationChangedListener)} and {@link #deactivate()}), a location provider should
 * push periodic location updates to the listener registered in {@link

 * battery-intensive services (like GPS) occasionally, or only while an activity is in the
 * foreground.
